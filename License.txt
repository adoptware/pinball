The core license is GPLv2+, not GPL+.
I have released hurd and professor2 on the same license on purpose to avoid creating problems with versions of the GPL.

The gnu table can create problem with a next release of GPL (a hypothetical GPLv4).

however, the full package including gnu must be released under GPLv3.
Or gnu should be kept separate.

It would be a good idea to contact Ben Asselstine for verify if it's possible to port gnu on GPLv3+.
So the entire project can be GPLv3+.

in fact also https://sourceforge.net/projects/pinball/ says License: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)
