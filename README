######################################################

Emilia Pinball is a open source pinball game for linux.

Requirements
============

Hardware rendering:
  300 Mhz cpu.
  OpenGL compatible gfx card.
  SDL 1.2.x, SDL_image and SDL_mixer libraries.

Recommended:
  450 Mhz PIII.
  Decent graphics card, voodoo3, tnt2, geforce, matrox g450 (you 
    do not need anything superfast), just need be capable of hardware 
    accelerated 3D.
  Latest SDL libaries, old libraries may have bugs.

Installing and building
=======================

It is best to remove any previous version of pinball before installing a new 
version. If you have used a rpm-package write as root user 'rpm -e pinball'. 
If you have installed from source code goto the pinball source directory and 
write as root user 'make uninstall'.

NOTE: A user and group named 'games' must exist before installation, this
user and group exist by default on most systems else:
useradd 'games' (as root user). Since hiscores as global to the system doesn't
work you don't need user games anymore.

After checking that you have the necessary libraries (SDL, SDL_IMAGE and
SDL_MIXER) installed you are ready to install. If you have an rpm-package 
you write as root user 'rpm -i pinball-x.x.x.rpm'.

If you compile from a source package check that you also have the have the 
development libraries installed. They usually have a name like 
sdl-devel.x.x.x.rpm. Then install with the usual:

Did you remember to install the development packages of SDL? Did you remember
to install also SDL_Image and SDL_Mixer?

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make install (as root ) or src/pinball
make clean (if you want to save some disc space)

Note: 
Multithread make ( make -j3 ) fixed in version 0.3.3.1

The game is started with 'pinball'.

FAQ
===

Graphics card known to work: Voodoo3, Matrox G450, GeForce4.
Compiles without problems on: RedHat 7.3, 8.0, 9.0, Debian 3.0.

Q: The 'boot' and 'tux' lights on the floor blinks or have vertical
lines?
A: Some buggy implementations of OpenGL does not implement the polygon
offset command - which is need by the game for correct rendering.

Q: Sounds are delayed with 0.5 seconds?
A: You're either using arts, esd or have buggy audio drivers. Stop
arts and esd, if that does not help install alsa drivers.

Q: The rpm doesn't fit my dist and the source won't compile?
Search the web for rpms, e.g. Mandrake rpms seems to pop up on
rpmfind a couple of weeks/months after my releases. For compiling:
doublecheck that you the _development_ packages of OpenGL, X, SDL,
SDL_image, SDL_mixer are installed.

Q: Can I help?
A: Yes, I would like to check that the physics model of the game is
somewhat like a real pinball machine whitout putting all my money into
the pinball games at the local game corner. So if you have a spare
pinball machine send it to me (it don't think it will fit in the
mail though...).
